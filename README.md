# RoundTrip

GPS locations cycler for Android 6.0+ (API >= 23 required).

## Usage

Install the APK and make sure to allow mock locations to be used with RoundTrip from developer options.

Once in the app, give it all the required location permissions and sign up to be able to add and see cities and locations.

The app relies on a real-time database that automatically syncs with all your devices connected with your account.

Hold an item to start GPS manipulation or to delete cities or coordinates you may have setup in your account.

*Kill the application* (and free the RAM) in order to kill all the GPS services thay may still be active once you exit the application. Please note that RoundTrip runs in the background.
